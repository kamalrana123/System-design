# Introduction to Web Security

Web security is a critical aspect of system design, focusing on protecting websites and web applications from a wide range of threats and vulnerabilities.

## Common Web Security Threats

-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker injects malicious scripts into a trusted website, which are then executed by unsuspecting users.
-   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** An attacker manipulates a web application's SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to a database.
-   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker tricks a user into performing an unintended action on a web application where they are authenticated.
-   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** An attacker floods a web server with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

## Best Practices for Web Security

-   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user input to prevent malicious data from being processed.
-   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to resources.
-   **HTTPS:** Use HTTPS to encrypt all communication between the client and server.
-   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
