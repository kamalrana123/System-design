# HTTP Protocol

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.

## Key Concepts

-   **Client-Server Model:** HTTP operates as a request-response protocol in the client-server computing model.
-   **Stateless:** Each HTTP request is independent and does not retain any information from previous requests.
-   **Methods:** Common HTTP methods include:
    -   `GET`: Requests a representation of the specified resource.
    -   `POST`: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.
    -   `PUT`: Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.
    -   `DELETE`: Removes the specified resource.

## HTTPS

HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is an extension of HTTP that uses encryption for secure communication over a computer network. It is widely used for protecting sensitive data, such as online banking and e-commerce transactions.
