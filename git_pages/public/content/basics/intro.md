# Welcome to the System Design Docs

This is a simple, flexible documentation site built with **React** and **Markdown**.

## How it works
- The site uses `HashRouter` for GitHub Pages compatibility.
- Content is loaded dynamically from markdown files.
- Navigation is controlled by `routes.json`.

## Features
- ✅ **Markdown Rendering**: Write standard Markdown.
- ✅ **GFM Support**: Tables, checklists, and more.
- ✅ **GitHub Styling**: Looks just like a README on GitHub.
