# OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct abstraction layers. Each layer serves a specific purpose and communicates with the layers directly above and below it.

## The 7 Layers of the OSI Model

1.  **Physical Layer:** Responsible for the physical connection between devices, including cables, switches, and other raw data transmission hardware.
2.  **Data Link Layer:** Manages node-to-node data transfer and error correction between devices on the same network.
3.  **Network Layer:** Handles routing and forwarding of data packets between different networks.
4.  **Transport Layer:** Provides reliable data transfer services, ensuring data is delivered completely and in the correct order.
5.  **Session Layer:** Manages sessions between applications, including setup, coordination, and termination.
6.  **Presentation Layer:** Translates, encrypts, and compresses data to ensure it is in a usable format for the application layer.
7.  **Application Layer:** The highest layer, which interacts directly with end-user applications and provides services like email, file transfer, and web browsing.
