# More Networking Concepts

This section covers other important networking concepts that are essential for understanding system design.

## DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS is the phonebook of the internet, translating human-readable domain names (like `www.google.com`) into machine-readable IP addresses (like `172.217.16.142`).

## Load Balancing

Load balancing is the process of distributing network traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server becomes overwhelmed. This improves the performance, reliability, and availability of applications.

## CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)

A CDN is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end-users.
